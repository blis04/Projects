This project is a spell checker for any word document being uploaded. What I did was i built and utilized double collision hash tables to store and search for words within a file of all possible words in near constant time. I then used funcitons in my python classes to search through the document and find incorrect spellings. The incorrectly spelled words were taken and put into seperate altering algorithms to then give the user a list of possible spellings that would fit the document better. I then compared the run times with asymptomatic analyses to enhance the efficiency in my data
